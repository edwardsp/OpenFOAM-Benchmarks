To run the case with the pre-generated mesh (just need to convert it) use the script run_all.sh

To generate the mesh with SHM and run the case use the script run_all_shm.sh

Generating the mesh with SHM is time consuming so better use the pre-generated mesh.

The scripts run with 4 procs, you will need to adapt them according to the number of procs you want to use
